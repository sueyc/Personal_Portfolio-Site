<h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
<p>I am a 54 year old wife and mother of a wonderful eleven year old boy.  At the age of 51 I decided to start on a new career and chose Computer Programmer/Analyst as I have always had an interest in computers.  I converted my fathers Architectural practice to computers in the 1980s. I worked on mainframe systems at a mechanical contracting firm in the 1980s and was always crashing their system because I was told I input too fast.  I have always been very business oriented and the COBOL programming course that I took at Georgian College was very business oriented and has struck a chord with me.  It has sparked an interest in mainframe programming and I am thinking that this is an area that I might like to pursue in the future.</p>
