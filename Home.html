<div id="mission">
<p>I have always had an interest in computers and how they work.  To be able to work with computers for a living is very exciting to me.  Providing good quality service is important to me because in business today it can be sadly lacking. A happy customer is the best result you can possibly have after completing a project and having that keeps me working as hard as I possibly can.</p>
