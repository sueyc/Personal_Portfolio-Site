<p>This was a project completed for my Animation 2D Tools course at Georgian College.  It involved using Adobe Flash Professional CS6 to produce a movie clip of 2 balls.  One was bouncing on the ground and had a shadow.  The other came through the screen from the other direction in a wavy motion above the "floor" level.</p>
