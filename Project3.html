<p>This was a program written in my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming course at Georgian College.  It involved designing a program for a ticket machine that issues tickets for a specific price.  It calculates the total amount deposited, and runs a total amount taken in by the machine.  It then prints the ticket.</p>
